# PARABOLIC-STOP-AND-REVERSE-PSAR-Strategy-at-closing-period-updated-v.3.5

Instructions are pretty straightforward for this one, simply pull and execute. The only note to consider is that I had to adjust the built-in "SAR" function so I implemented PSAR from scratch. If you're interested in the mechanics that underpin the model review the code.

  You can also adjust it to your liking if you have a custom modification of PSAR available.
