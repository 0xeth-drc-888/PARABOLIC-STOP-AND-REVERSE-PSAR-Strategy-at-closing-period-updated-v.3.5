# PARABOLIC-STOP-AND-REVERSE-PSAR-Strategy-at-closing-period-updated-v.3.5

Instructions are pretty straightforward for this one, simply pull and execute. The only note to consider is that I had to adjust the built-in "sar" function so I implemented PSAR from scratch. If you're interested in how it's work inside you can check the code and probably adjust to your need if you have a custom modification of PSAR available.
